To expedite resolution and reduce the cost of\n            any dispute, controversy or claim related to this Agreement\n            (“Dispute”), you and FYT agree to first attempt to negotiate\n            any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below)\n            informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any\n            arbitration or court proceeding. Such informal negotiations will\n            commence upon written notice. Your address for such notices is your\n            billing address, with an email copy to the email address you have\n            provided to FYT. FYT’s address for such notices is\n            FYT Technologies Inc., 38 Orchard Park Blvd, Toronto, ON M4L 3E2.\n            <br />\n            &zwj;\n            <br />\n            BINDING ARBITRATION. If you and FYT are unable to resolve a\n            Dispute through informal negotiations, all claims arising from use\n            of the Service (except those Disputes expressly excluded below)\n            finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. Any\n            election to arbitrate by one party will be final and binding on the\n            other. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IF EITHER PARTY ELECTS TO ARBITRATE,\n            NEITHER PARTY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY\n            TRIAL. The arbitration will be commenced and conducted under the\n            Commercial Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) of the American\n            Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s\n            Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA\n            Consumer Rules”), both of which are available at the AAA website{' '}\n            <a href=\"http://www.adr.org/\">www.adr.org</a>. Your arbitration fees\n            and your share of arbitrator compensation will be governed by the\n            AAA Rules (and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer\n            Rules). If your claim for damages does not exceed $10,000, FYT\n            will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the\n            substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for\n            Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as\n            measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil\n            Procedure 11(b)). The arbitration may be conducted in person,\n            through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The\n            arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a\n            statement of reasons unless requested by a party. The arbitrator\n            must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the\n            arbitrator fails to do so. Except as otherwise provided in this\n            Agreement, you and FYT may litigate in court to compel\n            arbitration, stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm,\n            modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the\n            arbitrator.\n            <br />\n            &zwj;\n            <br />\n            WAIVER OF RIGHT TO BE A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN A PURPORTED\n            CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. You and FYT agree\n            that any arbitration will be limited to the Dispute between\n            FYT and you individually. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU\n            AND FYT ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A\n            PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR\n            REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and FYT\n            otherwise agree, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one\n            person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any\n            class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is\n            held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution”\n            Section will be deemed null and void.\n            <br />\n            &zwj;\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            <span>\n              <strong className=\"head\">\n                16.
