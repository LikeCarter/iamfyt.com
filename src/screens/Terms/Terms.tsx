            To use the Service, you will need to register and create an account
            (including your full name, password, and email address). If you
            upgrade your account, you will need to provide payment information
            as well. FYT accounts will give you access to the Service and
            functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time
            and in our sole discretion. We may maintain different types of
            accounts for different types of users. If you open a FYT
            account on behalf of a company, organization, or other entity, then
            (a) “you” includes you and that entity, and (b) you represent and

            the authority to bind the entity to this Agreement, and that you
            agree to this Agreement on the entity’s behalf. By connecting to
            FYT with a third-party service, you give us permission to
            access and use your information from that service as permitted by
            that service, and to store your login credentials for that service.
            For more information on the types of information we collect from
            these third-party services, please read our Global Privacy Policy.

            individuals that hold legal claim or trademark on those usernames.

            unauthorized person shall have access to your account or password.
            &nbsp;When creating your account, you must provide accurate and
            complete information. We encourage you to use “strong” passwords
            (passwords that use a combination of upper- and lowercase letters,
            numbers, and symbols) with your account. It is your sole
            responsibility to: (i) control the dissemination and use of your
            account and password, and (ii) promptly inform us of any need to
            deactivate an account or password. We are not liable for any harm
            related to the theft of passwords, or your disclosure of passwords.
            You shall immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your
            account or password or any breach of confidentiality. You are solely
            responsible for any damage resulting from the use of your account
            and username. You may not use your account or password to breach
            security of another account.

            are deemed your “end users.” FYT does not have a direct
            relationship with any of your end users, therefore FYT is not

            restrictive than this Terms of Service. Use of the Services does not

            or exposure including the root cause, remediation steps, and
            compensating controls to ensure such a breach does not occur in the
            future.

            INFORMAL NEGOTIATIONS. To expedite resolution and reduce the cost of
            any dispute, controversy or claim related to this Agreement
            (“Dispute”), you and FYT agree to first attempt to negotiate
            any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below)
            informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any
            arbitration or court proceeding. Such informal negotiations will
            commence upon written notice. Your address for such notices is your
            billing address, with an email copy to the email address you have
            provided to FYT. FYT’s address for such notices is
            FYT Technologies Inc., 38 Orchard Park Blvd, Toronto, ON M4L 3E2.

            &zwj;
            <br />
            BINDING ARBITRATION. If you and FYT are unable to resolve a
            Dispute through informal negotiations, all claims arising from use
            of the Service (except those Disputes expressly excluded below)
            finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. Any
            election to arbitrate by one party will be final and binding on the
            other. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IF EITHER PARTY ELECTS TO ARBITRATE,
            NEITHER PARTY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY
            TRIAL. The arbitration will be commenced and conducted under the
            Commercial Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) of the American
            Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s
            Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA
            Consumer Rules”), both of which are available at the AAA website{' '}
            <a href="http://www.adr.org/">www.adr.org</a>. Your arbitration fees
            and your share of arbitrator compensation will be governed by the
            AAA Rules (and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer
            Rules). If your claim for damages does not exceed $10,000, FYT
            will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the
            substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for
            Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as
            measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil
            Procedure 11(b)). The arbitration may be conducted in person,
            through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The
            arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a
            statement of reasons unless requested by a party. The arbitrator
            must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the
            arbitrator fails to do so. Except as otherwise provided in this
            Agreement, you and FYT may litigate in court to compel
            arbitration, stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm,
            modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the
            arbitrator.

            WAIVER OF RIGHT TO BE A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN A PURPORTED
            CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. You and FYT agree
            that any arbitration will be limited to the Dispute between
            FYT and you individually. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU
            AND FYT ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A
            PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR
            REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and FYT
            otherwise agree, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one
            person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any
            class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is
            held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution”
            Section will be deemed null and void.

            available for use in locations outside Canada, and accessing the
            Service from territories where its use is illegal is prohibited.
            Those who access or use the Service from other jurisdictions do so
            at their own volition and are entirely responsible for compliance
            with all applicable Canadian and local laws and regulations,
            including but not limited to export and import regulations. You may
            not use the Service if you are a resident of a country embargoed by
            Canada, or are a foreign person or entity blocked or denied by the
            Canadian government. Unless otherwise explicitly stated, all
            materials found on the Service are solely directed to individuals,
            companies, or other entities located in the United States.

            supersedes all prior to contemporaneous agreements or
            understandings, written or oral. The Terms of Service shall be

            <strong>d. No waiver</strong><br/>Any failure by us to enforce or
            exercise any provisions of the Terms of Service shall not constitute
            a waiver of that right or provision. Our failure to act with respect
            to a breach by you or others does not waive our rights to act with
            respect to subsequent or similar breaches.

            relief, or both, in addition to any damages that FYT may be
            legally entitled to recover, together with reasonable expenses of
            any form of dispute resolution, including, without limitation,
            attorneys' fees.

            waiver by FYT of its rights or remedies under these terms and
            conditions shall imply any obligation to grant any similar, future,
            or other waiver.
